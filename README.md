Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as “Noughts and Crosses,” is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns placing their symbol (either “X” or “O”) in an empty cell. The goal is to form a line of three of your symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. It’s a simple yet strategic game that has entertained generations! 😊
